some common defines:
<left paren> ::= (
<right paren> ::= )
<column name list> ::=
    <column name> [ { <comma> <column name> }... ]



DELETE
--------
by spec there are two types of delete statements, a "positioned" and a "searched".
I guess the "positioned" will have to wait a bit ... since it seems not very common, 
but if someone volunteers - go ahead

<delete statement: searched> ::=
	DELETE FROM <table name>
		[ WHERE <search condition> ]
				
<delete statement: positioned> ::=
	DELETE FROM <table name>
		WHERE CURRENT OF <cursor name>
		
				

INSERT 
--------
<insert statement> ::=
	INSERT INTO <table name>
		<insert columns and source>

<insert columns and source> ::=
	[ <left paren> <insert column list> <right paren> ]
	<query expression>
	| DEFAULT VALUES

<insert column list> ::= <column name list>

		 

UPDATE 
--------
<update statement: positioned> ::=
	UPDATE <table name>
		SET <set clause list>
		WHERE CURRENT OF <cursor name>

<set clause list> ::=
	<set clause> [ { <comma> <set clause> }... ]

<set clause> ::=
	<object column> <equals operator> <update source>

<update source> ::=
		<value expression>
	| <null specification>
	| DEFAULT

<object column> ::= <column name>


<update statement: searched> ::=
	UPDATE <table name>
		SET <set clause list>
		[ WHERE <search condition> ]

		
SELECT 
--------
<query specification> ::=
	SELECT [ <set quantifier> ] <select list> <table expression>

<select list> ::=
		<asterisk>
	| <select sublist> [ { <comma> <select sublist> }... ]

<select sublist> ::=
		<derived column>
	| <qualifier> <period> <asterisk>

<derived column> ::= <value expression> [ <as clause> ]

<as clause> ::= [ AS ] <column name>
