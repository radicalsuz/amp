Things to watch for when installing:

1. On the main AMP source install, make sure "AllowOverride All" is set, e.g.:

<Directory /home/amp/public_html>
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>

2. Make sure there is an .htaccess file in the main source directory (fixme)

3. Make sure a cache directory exists (and is properly aliased in apache), and is readable / writeable by the apache process.
