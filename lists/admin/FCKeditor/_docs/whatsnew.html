		<H3>Version 1.1</H3>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				The "<STRONG>Multi Language</STRONG>" system is now available. This version 
				ships with English and Italian versions completed. Other languages will be 
				available soon. The editor automatically detects the client language and sets 
				all labels, tooltips and dialog boxes to it, if available. The auto detection 
				and the default language can be set in the <STRONG>fck_config.file</STRONG>.
			<LI>
				Two files can now be created to isolate customizations code from the original 
				source code of the editor: <STRONG>fckeditor.config.js</STRONG> and <STRONG>fckeditor.custom.js</STRONG>. 
			Create these files in the root folder of your web site, if needed. The first 
			one can be used to add or override configurations set on fck_config.js. The 
			second one is used for custom actions and behaviors.
			<LI>
			A problem with relative links and images like "/test/test.doc" has been solved. 
			In prior versions, only with XHTML support enabled, the URL was changed to 
			something like "http://www.mysite.xxx/test/test.doc" (The domain was 
			automatically added). Now the XHTML cleaning procedure gets the URLs exactly 
			how they are defined in the editor’s HTML.

			language.
			<LI>
			[SF BUG-712103] The style command is localized, so it depends on the IE

				[SF BUG-726137] On version 0.9.5, some commands (special chars, image,
